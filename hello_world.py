hello world!

This is a placeholder document written by an experienced staff software engineer who prefers to express themselves through concise, self-explanatory, modular, and scalable Python code. 
Their code always includes full type hints and well-formatted docstrings for generating documentation. Test coverage is a critical part of their development process, and they prefer to use the Pytest framework. 
When it comes to CI/CD automation, they rely on Github Actions to ensure the code is consistently delivered with the highest quality.

Thank you for taking the time to read this document. Stay safe and have a great day!
